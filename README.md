A Python-based system monitoring and alerting tool that checks CPU, memory, disk usage, and service status. If resource usage exceeds defined thresholds, it sends an email alert.

## âœ… Features
- CPU, Memory, and Disk Usage Monitoring
- Windows Service Status Check (example: Spooler, W32Time)
- Threshold Alerts for CPU, Memory, and Disk
- Email Notifications when thresholds are exceeded
- Detailed System Information included in alert email:
  - OS
  - Python Version
  - CPU Cores
  - Total RAM
 
## ðŸš€ Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Install dependencies: pip install psutil

## ðŸš€ File Structure
- monitor.py # Main monitoring script
-  config.json # Configuration for thresholds, services, and email
-  logs.txt # Log file for monitoring results (auto-generated)
